# Basic Scripts For Trinity Core

This is something I am going to do on the side to help out new members get going with scripts for their server. I'm going to upload many scripts over time to this repository and keep them up to date so you wont have to. 

At the moment inside of this repo are the following scripts:
- World Chat
	- Supports .gm chat on BLIZZ icon.
	- Colored to look like a normal chat channel that you would /join


This repository will be updated over time and a whole lot more scripts will get added to it.

As I am working on my own projects and will not be able to constantly check them for issues. So i will be relying on you the users to let me know something is broken. 
	
If you want some other things like transmog I highly reccomend you go to http://rochet2.github.io He has a lot of very useful scripts and keeps them up to date himself.
